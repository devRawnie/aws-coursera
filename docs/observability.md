# Observability

### Monitoring

Act of collecting data

- Collect Metrics
- Collect Logs
- Monitor Network Traffic

### Observability

- Property of a system
- An observable system, lets us observe it via logs and metrics

## AWS X-RAY

- Allows us to debug de-centralized applications
- Provide end-to-end view of the request as it travells

- **SEGMENTS**: Compute resources running the application logic
- **SUB-SEGMENTS**: Provide granular details about segments
- **SERVICE-GRAPH**: JSON Document containing details about services in our application -> Used to visualize the request
- **TRACE**: Tracking the path of a request through the system, collecting all the segments generated by the request

Sampling Algorithm

- Determines which algorithm will get traced
- Default sampling rate: 1st request per second + 5% of additional request


## Integration

1. API Gateway

Two types of tracing
- Passive : Default. Requests would be traced if X-ray is active on an upstream service. I.E. if Tracing is enabled on API Gateway, it will add a tracing header to the request, which will tell other services to also trace the request
- Active : Enable tracing manually so that traces are recorded for sub-segments, not traced in Passive tracing, based on the Sampling Algorithm

API Gateway -> Stage -> Logs/Tracing section

SDK ---- Trace Data ---> X-Ray Daemon -> X-Ray API

**Trace Data**
- HTTP Requests
- Downstream Calls
- HTTP Clients
- SQL Database connectors

Annotations and Metadata can be added at the sub-segment level by the SDK

- Annotations: Key-Value pairs, associated with a trace ande used for searching the trace later
- Metadata: cannot be searched upon, but can be used to store further information. It can be Key-Value, Object, List

If code is running on AWS Lambda, the X-ray Daemon is installed and managed automatically
If code is running X-ray outside of Lambda you may need to install and manage the daemon yourself
